<p>Full stack web developer enthusiastic to help a company tell their story intuitively and meaningfully through developing and maintaining codebases. Experience in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and React. I excel at learning new technologies quickly, bringing ideas to life, and working with dedicated teams to build efficient and robust applications suited to the user’s needs. In my non-professional life, music production has given me considerable experience with learning syntax and linguistic pattern recognition which translates beautifully to writing code, and digital art has helped give me the ability to design aesthetically pleasing UI’s. I am excited to join a company where I can connect people through technology after dedicating my time to connecting people through music and art.</p>
