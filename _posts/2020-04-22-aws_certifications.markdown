Hi guys! I hope everyone is staying sane and staying safe. This pandemic is rough and is lasting longer than some of us anticipated. Even though it is not ideal, I’ve gotten some extra time to work on home renovations and other projects around the house as well as dedicate some time to making music. Like I said before, I’m available to chat if someone is lonely or struggling with the stay-at-home order. This week, I’ve been working on making slight changes to my resume to make it more readable and allow extra room for projects/skills/certificates. I’ve also applied to a couple of jobs and have been working on growing my LinkedIn connections which I hope will be helpful for my job hunt. I’m excited to have moved to Denver because I feel like I may have more opportunities and the tech community seems incredible so far. Most of the people I reach out to for insight are happy to help and answer my questions. Even though I’m not employed yet, I feel a strong sense of belonging in this community that I haven’t felt in a long time. I’m grateful to Flatiron Alum, my fellow cohort students, my coaches and everyone who is helping me/us to move along during this difficult time. 

I’ve recently been hearing a lot about AWS (Amazon Web Services) and how great their certifications are. I think it will be really helpful in my job search to have a couple of them on my resume. Since I’m new to AWS, I decided to start with the Introduction to AWS which has 7 lessons and a 1.5 hour video. After this is completed, I will move on to the AWS Certified Developer - Associate 2020 course which has 119 lessons and 16.1 hours of video. It includes access to the course, the course discussion forums and the practice exam. Then, I’ll take the exam itself. I’m a little nervous….

But I’m ready to take on this challenge because I’ve been wanting to do it for some time now. After its completion, I will write about my challenges, thoughts, and overall experience. Hopefully I will be able to offer some words of encouragement for other developers who have also been wanting to get an AWS cert. Meanwhile, I’ll do my best to set aside time to work on personal coding projects like my real estate app that still has a bug I have yet to figure out. And of course, I will continue sending out applications and networking with other developers and potential employers. Unfortunately, during the past couple of weeks I have not had time to complete code challenges on CodeWars and HackerRank which sucks because I had found them to be extremely helpful but my coach and I think working on this AWS cert is what’s best for me right now. 

If you’re new to Ruby and are trying to grasp Object Oriented Ruby, you can read my last three posts that go over it. I hope to write a part 4 soon. For now, I’ll be learning, reading, and coding!
