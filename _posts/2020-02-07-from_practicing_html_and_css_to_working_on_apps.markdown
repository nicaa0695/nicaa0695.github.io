In my most recent blog post, I talked about why I love Ruby and why it's great for beginners. Since graduating Flatiron, I almost feel more overwhelmed now than I did when I was in the course.

**THERE'S STILL SO MUCH TO LEARN!**

I feel like I grasped everything pretty well, but there's always so much more to learn. Seriously, you could spend a lifetime learning everything this industry has to offer. During the course, I had a set amount of time to learn what I needed to and pass the project for that section. Now that time isn't an issue, I've been able to go back and brush up on things that I didn't quite get enough time with. I've revisited both CSS and HTML, and it's not as simple as it seems. I've made a couple of my projects looks better with CSS since the course ended because I just didn't have time during school. 

There are so many things I want to jump into, like AWS certificates or just learning new languages but like I said, there's so much in Ruby on Rails and JavaScript that I can improve on. I feel like if I strengthen my skills with these languages a while longer, AWS and new languages will be easier for me to learn. 

**What I'm Working On Now**

I'm really interested in real estate and I'm currently looking for a house to buy in Denver. The market is CRAZY right now. I found a house I loved and it was under contract....within fifteen minutes.....

So I moved on, kept my cool, and it happened again....and again, and again. :) They are selling really fast, so if I see a house on Zillow or Redfin that I'd consider buying, I basically have to put in an offer immediately without going out to see the property. Scary right?

Just for fun, today I started building a real estate app that will be a Zillow clone. I'm going to use the Zillow API and focus on getting it up and running logically and making it look decent. After that, I plan on incorporating a way to be notified when a new house hits the market and somehow keep track of your mortgage preapprovals and a few other things to help increase your chances of purchasing your dream home. This project is going to be really hard but I'm excited to build it because it will be great practice and a chance for me to feel more confident working with Ruby on Rails. Wish me luck and let's see how this goes.
