I recently finished Flatiron's full-time software engineering program! It was very challenging but I learned so much. I'm so glad I chose Flatiron because everyone in my cohort was such a pleasure to learn with and my cohort lead, Morgan VanYperen, was an incredible teacher. Everyone in the tech field so far seems really welcoming and willing to lend a hand. I feel a sense of belonging that I haven't felt in awhile and I'm glad I decided to transition into coding. 

Now that I've graduated, I'm job searching which is more upsetting than I'd hoped it would be. Applying to job after job and hearing nothing back is disappointing and makes you feel like you're not what any employers are looking for. I've talked to several people who are or were in the same boat and it's helpful to be reminded that everything takes time. In the meanwhile, I am filling in gaps in both JS and Ruby on Rails, studying, building small apps to get more practice and working on improving my interview skills. I'd say I'm pretty good at writing code but I struggle with talking about/explaining exactly what the code does. I need to work on my technical vocabulary and I've found that reading blogs, watching YouTube tutorials, and just practicing have been helping me improve that. 

I will continue to work on my skills and make sure I don't become discouraged while job hunting. If anybody would like to connect with me, feel free! [LinkedIn]( https://www.linkedin.com/in/veronicalopezdev/) - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nicalopezdev)
