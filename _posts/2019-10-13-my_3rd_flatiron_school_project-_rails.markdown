I thought, "Oh no, the time has come again, another project?".  I started thinking about what kind of app I wanted to build. I've been cooking a lot so I thought maybe I'd add onto/convert my Recipes app. Then I thought it might be more advantageous for me to build a completely new project; I'd learn more. So I decided to build an app that allows you to track your workouts. You can let the app know what you focused on as well as what exercises you did while working out. You can login in with an email and password or login via facebook.

As intimidating it is, I dove right in. Of course I ran into some issues, we all do. Debugging is a pain but at least we learn from our mistakes. I had issues with OAuth, so many, in fact, that I decided  half way through the week that it would just be best to start over on this project... So I did. The second time around, I got to re-use some code but just made sure I was more careful about setting up OAuth. This time around it was better. I'm still not very good at CSS, so for now my app just has a simple background gradient. Prior to the end of the course, I plan on styling all my projects so at future interviews, I have more to "show off". 

I'm looking forward to the Javascript portion of the course. I've found a new love for learning to code. I knew coming in that it'd always be harder than I thought, but I'm glad I'm willing to absorb everything and willing to be uncomfortable. Huge shout out to my cohort lead, Morgan VanYperen, for answering any ridiculous questions I have and for always supporting us! 
On to the next obstacle!
