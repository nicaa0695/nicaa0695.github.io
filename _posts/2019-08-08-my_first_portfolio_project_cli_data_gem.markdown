First thought: Well, that was intense!

I'm very excited to have just finished my first portfolio project! We've learned so much in less than month and it was a little more challenging than I thought it would be. However, I'm proud of myself for creating something from scratch. After studying and doing labs and read-me's, it's so rewarding to have built something from everything we've learned about Object Oriented Ruby! 

Before I started the project I couldn't help but think, "Hmm, where do I even start?" I had to gather myself and think of all the work we've done so far in the program. It was challenging to me to create a repository and figure out which directories and files I need and where exactly they should go. I was so used to them already being set up for me with tests included and all I had to do was write code. But it was great and I learned a lot! 

My project allows users to view a list of running shoes from Famous Footwear. They can select a particular shoe they'd like more information about by typing 1-96. They can type 'list' to see the shoes again, or 'exit' to leave.  When they select a shoe, it displays the shoe name, the price, if it's in stock and a url for that shoe. I got stuck quite often. When that happened I would review Avi's CLI Walkthrough video, reach out to my instructor, or do a little research on google. I also found it really helpful to pseudocode and write my plans out in plain english before even writing actual code. I think my project can be improved and I'm looking forward to the review with my instructor. Overall, it was a challenging but really exciting task and I'm looking forward to learning so much more!
